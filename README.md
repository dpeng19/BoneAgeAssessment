# BoneAgeAssessment
Two ML models that automate bone age assessment (BAA): 
SVM.py: support-vector regression model  
CNN.py: convolutional neural network model  

The convolutional neural network outperforms the support-vector regression model, as it achieves a mean absolute error of around 18 months, compared to 32 months for the support-vector regression model.
